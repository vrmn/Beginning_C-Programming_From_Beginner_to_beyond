C ++ is super fast. It's a general purpose programming language that supports both procedural and object oriented programming.

Caveat C++ is complex.

Modern C++ and the C++ standard.

How does it all work?

Program is like a recipe for the computer. It tells it what to do.

Programming language ( the source code )  is high level and intended for humans. This is C++, Java, python ect.

You'll use an editor to write the source code.

Binary code ( object code ) is low level for the computer to understand.

A compiler translates from high-level to low level.

Linker links together our code with other libraries.

Finally Test and debug


The C++ Build Process

Write source code .cpp

Then Compiler turns translates the source code into object code .obj

Finally the object files and any libraries that our program requires must be linked together.

This final step creates an executive file that can run.
On windows its .exe linux and mac don't have an extension.
